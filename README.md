TextPadPro is a macOS menu bar app for pasting reusable text snippets into any application.
It supports a companion iOS/iPadOS app (TextPadRemote) for remote editing and paste control
over the local network.

Remote Features
TextPadPro listens for local network connections (Bonjour/TCP) to support TextPadRemote.
Both devices must be on the same Wi-Fi network.
